		<h1>About</h1>

		<section>
			<p>Is it possible to change the world? Can we still make the planet a better place for us all to live? UNICEF special adviser Claudia Romo Edelman and Hub Culture executive editor Edie Lush -- hosts of the Global Goalscast -- believe the answer is a resounding 'yes,' and that everyone can play a part.</p>
			<p>Edelman and Lush will rely on the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals to guide their agenda: telling inspiring stories about people advancing a more sustainable future and sharing tips on how listeners can follow in their "carbon free footsteps."</p>
			<p>Each episode will focus on a separate issue as they relate to current events and Sustainable Development Goals, such as ending poverty, combating climate change, and ensuring equality.</p>
			<p>The podcast will be distributed by CBS News Digital and promoted by partners including UN agencies and international NGOs. Each episode will educate and entertain as it offers listeners inspirational stories of people and initiatives helping us progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
			<p>The podcast will draw on high quality development data, and set out numerous ways for everyone to take action and personally be a contributor to changing the planet for the better.</p>
