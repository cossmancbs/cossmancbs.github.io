				<p>The Navy says it is mobilizing barges outfitted with heavy lift cranes to help clear the channel of debris. Three cranes with varying lift capacities are expected, along with support vessels to remove submerged portions of the bridge, but it's unclear when they will arrive.</p>
				<small>metadata</small>
				<p class="verdict">Verdict: ðŸŸ¡ no font issues, but truncation is necessary, due to nonstandard headline and dek lengths.</p>

				<h1>Line-clamp:</h1>
				<h2 class="webkit-line-clamp3">Jorem jpsum jolor jit jmet jonsectetur jdipiycijg jypg jed joyipg</h2>

Three cranes with varying lift capacities are expected, along with support vessels to remove submerged portions of the bridge, but it's unclear when they will arrive.</p>
				<small>metadata</small>
				<p class="verdict">Verdict: ðŸ”´ Requires <code>overflow: hidden</code>, which causes issues with this particular font. Adjusting <code>padding</code> and <code>spacing</code> is not an option, as it would disrupt alignment.</p>
